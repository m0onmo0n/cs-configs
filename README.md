launchoptions are my launchoptions
+jump and -jump are used for jump using scrollwheel.
autoexec is self explainatory
moondemo is my config for when i'm watching demos(for cswatch.in for example)
im, zywoo and niko are config files for their viewmodels. in the autoexec it executes one of these(i'm using the niko one right now) but you can easily change it by either writing the one you want in the console or changing the line in the autoexec
